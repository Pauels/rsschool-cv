### About me
I'm 39 years old. I work as an engineer for the operation of power equipment at a CHP. I had an interest in programming since my school days. From the 7th to the 9th grade I was engaged in programming at a school circle in secondary school № 33 in Grodno. At the age of 15, after the 9th grade, at the family council it was decided that I would study far from the field of programming. I started taking my first steps in 2006 - I independently studied HTML and CSS. In 2008, he independently developed and launched the Internet project “Avtoservis.by - Catalog of Automotive Companies in Minsk”, the project has been successfully working for 3 years, independently brought it to the first positions in the search on yandex.by, google.by. A stable life position, striving for development, realization of personal qualities have always been my I. Working in an IT company for me is teamwork; development and adoption of decisions; broad development prospects; brainstorm; work on the case without wasting time on empty tasks, the result of which is not needed by anyone. The programming language is constantly being improved, and with it its experts are also improving.
